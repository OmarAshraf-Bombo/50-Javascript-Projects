        <h3>How big is the moon?</h3>
        <p>The moon is about 2,000 miles across.</p>

        <h3>How far is it from Earth to the moon?</h3>
        <p>It is about 250,000 miles from Earth to the moon.</p>

        <h3>How old is the moon?</h3>
        <p>The moon is the same age as the Earth and the rest of the solar system — about 4.5 billion years. Our solar
            system was all formed at that time.</p>

        <h3>How did the moon form?</h3>
        <p>We think that the moon and Earth formed at about the same time, back when our whole solar system was formed.
            Earth was forming from many chunks of rock and icy material. Possibly a big chunk hit the new Earth and
            knocked
            loose a big piece, which became the moon.</p>

        <h3>How hot and cold does it get on the moon?</h3>
        <p>As you may have learned, the moon doesn't have any air around it. The air that surrounds our earth acts as a
            nice blanket to keep us warm and comfy! But the moon, since it doesn't have this blanket, gets much colder
            than
            the earth — and much hotter than the earth. On the side of the moon that the sun is shining on, the
            temperature
            reaches 260°Fahrenheit! That is hotter than boiling. On the dark side of the moon, it gets very cold, -280°
            Fahrenheit.</p>

        <h3>What is the surface of the moon like?</h3>
        <p>The surface of the moon has about two inches of dust. Much of this dust has fallen to the moon from the
            spaces
            between the planets over the last several billions years. It probably feels pretty soft. You can see this in
            some pictures taken by the astronauts of their footprints on the moon.</p>

        <h3>How many holes are in the moon?</h3>
        <p>We call those holes "craters." They are the places where many years ago meteors hit the surface of the moon
            and
            put dents into it. There are thousands of big craters, but even more little ones. There are probably
            millions of
            little craters on the moon! Some are only an inch or so across.</p>

        <h3>Why does the moon have big rocks?</h3>
        <p>The moon is made up of various kinds of rocks. These rocks are fairly similar to the rocks on earth. But on
            earth, we have wind and rain that help wear the rocks down into sand and dirt. There is no air or wind on
            the
            moon, so the rocks don't get worn down as they do on the earth.</p>
